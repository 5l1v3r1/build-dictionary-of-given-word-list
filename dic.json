The word also denoted various devices saving human labour, as though one had a helper (jack (sense 1, jack sense 3, jack sense 9, jack sense 10), and in compounds such as jackhammer and jackknife); the general sense ‘labourer’ arose in the early 18th century and survives in cheapjack, lumberjack, steeplejack, etc. Since the mid 16th century a notion of ‘smallness’ has arisen, hence jack (sense 4, jack sense 5, jack sense 7, jack sense 13).",
